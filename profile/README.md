Hey there! This is the original repo for HERON Mk II, the first fully-assembled CubeSat by Space Systems. We've decommissioned this organization, and transferred all of the repos to [the unified `utat-ss` org](https://github.com/utat-ss). You'll find the code there, as well as what we're working on now. See you there!
